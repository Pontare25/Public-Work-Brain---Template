## Projects
>Short-term efforts in your work or life that you are working on now.

Projects are **short-term** efforts with two key elements:
- A defined **goal** or outcome
- A deadline (or at least an estimated completion time)

A project is something you can finish. You should be able to do a task within a project and feel _tangible progress_ towards the project’s completion. Projects are about **outcomes.**
For example:
- Complete webpage design
- Buy a new computer
- Write research report
- Renovate the bathroom
- Finish Spanish language course
- Set up new living room furniture

All projects have **specific success criteria** and **deadlines**!
I’m stressing this – much like Tiago does in his book – because many people have a much fuzzier definition of “project”. Ask a person what projects they have on their plate right now, and you’re likely to get answers like:
- Organize my office
- Stay healthy
- Keep on top of customer support tickets
These are actually [[2 - Areas|Areas]], because all of them indicate a _standard to be maintained._ None of them have a defined outcome, so putting effort into them doesn’t get you any closer to “done”.
Projects should take up the bulk of your attention and energy, as they are what actually move you closer to the **outcomes** you want in life.
