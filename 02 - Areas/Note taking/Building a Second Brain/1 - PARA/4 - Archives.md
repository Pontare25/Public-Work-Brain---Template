## Archives
>Inactive items from the other three categories

Finally, you have **archives**, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active, but you might want to save for future reference:
- Projects you’ve completed or put on hold
- Areas that are no longer active or relevant
- Resources that you’re no longer interested in
