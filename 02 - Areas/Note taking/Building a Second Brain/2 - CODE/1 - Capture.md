# Capture
The initial step is to capture knowledge you find valuable. These are known as [[Knowledge assets]]. These can be 
## External 
Such as:
- Book highlights, 
- links to interesting content
## Internal
Such as:
- Personal ideas and stories
## What should you capture?
Choose questions that intrigue you and are important to your work and life. These *favourite problems* stay consistent over time and guide your personal growth. 
## Capture information effectively
Think like a curator; save just the most important parts. 
When deciding what to keep you can ask four questions
1. Does it inspire me?
2. Is it useful?
3. Is it personal?
4. Is it surprising?
Capture ideas that challenge your thinking or bring a new perspective. 
These questions will help you decide what to capture but more importantly keep inly what intuitively resonates with you. 
## Utilize capture tools

	- [[Instagram]]
- Basic notes apps

- Audio/Video transcriptions
- Web-clipper apps

Each of these has a purpose in helping you capture content effortlessly.
