# Organize
We want to organize the Second brain for actionability rather than creating a perfect hierarchy of folders up front. 
Instead organize around your [[Active projects]]. Think about organizing information like setting up a kitchen for cooking. This is where [[0 - PARA|PARA]] comes in. It will organize your information into 4 categories. 
- [[1 - Projects]]
	- Like pots and pans on an active stove these are the things you are working on right now. Such as designing a web-page or planning a vacation. 
- [[2 - Areas]]
	- Similar to items in the fridge they are for ongoing responsibilities you frequently check on, such as managing finances or overseeing product development. 
- [[3 - Resources]]
	- Similar to items in the pantry they are available for future use like hobbies, habits, or industry trends. 
- [[4 - Archives]]. 
	- Similar to the freezer, items are in storage until needed possibly far into the future. Like inactive items from Projects, Areas, or Resources.
