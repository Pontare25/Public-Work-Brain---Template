# Distill
Think of your first notes as raw material. They must be processed and refined to become valuable knowledge assets. 
## Guidelines
### 1 - Design notes for your future self
Think of note taking as time travel. Make your notes easily discoverable for your future self by defining key terms, inserting placeholders, and adding links to related content. 
Think of it like how librarians arrange books or how websites have user-friendly menus. 
### 2 - Summarise progressively
At various levels of detail. In a nutshell summarise your notes in layers by highlighting each layer in a different format. Such as **bold**, *italic*,  ==highlight==, and a written summary. 
For example, capture the main points from an article and then create a second layer by bolding the main points of those highlights. This method makes it easier to grasp the essence of a note quickly. 
It is like a digital map where you can zoom in for details or zoom out for a broader view. 
### 3 - Distill gradually
Instead of creating perfect notes all at once, add value little by little each time you touch a note. 
Make it better by giving it a good title, highlighting important points or linking to other related notes.
