# Express
The main purpose of gathering and organizing knowledge is to *share it with others*.
For those who love learning there's a tendency to keep collecting information without applying it. 
But what is the point of knowledge if it doesn't help anyone or create anything?
## Create valuable output
To create valuable output start by shifting from constantly consuming information to creating things. Utilize your stored knowledge to generate content such as articles and white papers. 
## Break it down 
Second, break projects into *intermediate packets*, i.e., small manageable units serving as building blocks for your work. 
For instance when planning a conference these blocks can be the: *Agenda*, *Breakout sessions*, *Keynote checklist*. 
Instead of taking on an entire project all at once, focus on completing one intermediate packet at a time. 
## Share your work with others
Lastly start sharing your work with others. Whether it is an E-book or a brief post expressing your thoughts. This can lead to benefits like forming new connections and attracting new clients.
