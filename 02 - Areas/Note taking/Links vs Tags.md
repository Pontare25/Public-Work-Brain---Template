# Intro
The whole second brain workflow is meant to allow new ideas to easily bubble to the surface. 

Obsidian is a bi-directional linking note taking tool.

There are two main ways of linking notes in Obsidian; backlinks which should be considered hard links, and tags that should be considered as soft association links. 

If you think of backlinks as a relation strongly connected such as blood relatives, tags are more like connecting two people who happen to live in the same city. 
# Links
If you are unsure whether to use a link or a tag it is likely better to use a link. 
You can create links by writing two square brackets. Note that a note does not have to exist for you to link to it. This enables a very powerful feature of many links being able to link to the same either existing or non-existing note. This also means that you don't have to interrupt your current workflow to create the note. Instead you can leave it for now and flesh it out at your convenience. 
# Tags
## When should you use tags?
Generally the amount of tags should be kept to a minimum. It is very easy to overuse tags and simply tag everything with as much as possible. 
## Categories of tags
Since Obsidian support nested tags I recommend to keep basically just three main categories of tags. 
### Type/
The "*Type*" tag is used to provide a skeleton/ structure of your notes.
For example you can use the Type/Person to tag all people or additionally nested tags such as Type/Meeting/Work/Workshop
### On/
The "*On*" tag is meant to add some colour to your notes to differentiate them from the generic Type. For example, topics. On/Note-taking/Links
