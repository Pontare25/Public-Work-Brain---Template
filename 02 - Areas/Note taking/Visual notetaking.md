# Excalidraw
[[Excalidraw]] is one of the most downloaded [[Community plugins]] on the Obsidian market. 
It is a fairly light-weight application that is written entirely in [[Markdown]] which makes it very compatible with Obsidian. 
It allows you to create infinite drawings using shapes, text, arrows, lines, icons, images and SVG files. 
Since it is markdown based and also allows for grouping of elements it also allows you to embed specific portions of a drawing without having to create duplicates.
